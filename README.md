# Stock Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate how to build and train an LSTM model to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing (scaling, creating sequences)
- LSTM model architecture definition
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of predictions against actual prices

## Installation

To run this notebook, you'll need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-lstm.git
   cd stock-prediction-lstm
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stock_prediction_lstm.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run all cells** in the notebook to see the stock prediction in action.

## Data

The notebook uses a sample stock dataset (e.g., from Yahoo Finance). You can replace this with your own stock data. The data should ideally contain at least 'Date' and 'Close' price columns.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model consists of:
- An LSTM layer
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Dense layers for output

## Results

The notebook will display plots showing:
- The original stock prices
- The predicted stock prices
- The training and validation loss curves

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by improving the model, adding new features, or enhancing the visualizations.
